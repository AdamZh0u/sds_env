## Errors Starting a Container

Many applications assume that the user's home directory (where your user stores files) has a name that contains only plain-Latin characters (so no Chinese, or even French sometimes!). This can cause the `$(pwd)` part of the command above to fail. 

:::

If you see some kind of error about the **path being unreadable**. Fret not! You need to use the Latin 'alias' (a second name using only the Latin alphabet) to the current directory. You can usually find in the PowerShell: it will be something *like* `C:\Users\a1509\` in which case just replace the `$(pwd)` with this and you *should* be good to go.

::: {.callout-warning}

If you have issues at this point, please see the more extensive guidacne on [Using Docker](../docker/index.qmd).
