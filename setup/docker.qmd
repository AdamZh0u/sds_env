## Copy Code to Clipboard 

Whenever you see a 'code block', you will _also_ see a 'clipboard' icon (![Copy to Clipboard Icon](../img/copy-to-clipboard.png){height="18px"}) in the right. Click that, and the code will be copied to your computer's 'clipboard' so that you can then paste it into the `Terminal` or `Power Shell`. That will save you a lot of time and effort.

## Docker

## Windows Users

Please ensure that you have installed WSL2 *before* installing Docker!

After you've installed Docker, You must start the Docker app running before any of the commands below will work. You'll know that you've succeeded when you see the 'Docker Desktop' window appear listing downloaded images and running containers.

#### Downloading the {{< var env.image >}} Image

To test if Docker is installed correctly, try running this command in either the `Terminal` (macOS) or the `Power Shell` (Windows):

## Intel Macs and Windows

If your Apple computer has an Intel chipset (see: &#63743; -> `About this Mac` -> `Processor`) or is running Windows:

```bash
docker pull {{< var env.image >}}
```

## M-Chip Silicon Macs

If your Apple computer has an M1 or M2 'Silicon' chipset (see: &#63743; -> `About this Mac` -> `Processor`): 

```bash
docker pull {{< var env.image >}}-silicon
```

:::

You should see a lot of 'layers' being copied down -- about 10GB worth -- so don't do this over a cellular connection! If that *doesn't* happen then you may need to do [more reading about Docker](../docker/index.qmd).

#### Starting the {{< var env.name >}} Container

::: {.panel-tabset}

## For Intel Macs

Once the `pull` process completes you'll need to copy+paste the following into the `Terminal` as the *bare minimum* for getting up and running:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name {{< var env.name >}} -p 8888:8888 \
   -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" \
  {{< var env.image >}} start.sh jupyter lab \
  --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''
```

## For M-Chip Macs

Once the `pull` process completes you'll need to copy+paste the following into the `Terminal` as the *bare minimum* for getting up and running:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name {{< var env.name >}} -p 8888:8888 \
   -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" \
  {{< var env.image >}}-silicon start.sh jupyter lab \
  --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''
```

## For Windows

::: {.callout-warning}
## Windows 

You should follow [this Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers#install-docker-desktop) to ensure that `Use the WSL 2 based engine` is checked. This may require restarting Docker.
:::

Once the `pull` process completes you'll need to copy+paste the following into the `Power Shell` (*note*: **not into the Command Prompt (cmd)**). Note that this is the one-line version for Windows users:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name {{< var env.name >}} -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" {{< var env.image >}} start.sh jupyter lab --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''
```

## Errors Starting a Container

Many applications assume that the user's home directory (where your user stores files) has a name that contains only plain-Latin characters (so no Chinese, or even French sometimes!). This can cause the `$(pwd)` part of the command above to fail. You will see some kind of error about the docker command failing and something about the path being unreadable. Fret not! You also have a Latin 'alias' to that directory which you can usually find using the PowerShell; it will be something *like* `C:\Users\a1509\` in which case just replace the `$(pwd)` with this and you *should* be good to go.

If you have issues at this point, then you'll need to do [more reading](../docker/index.qmd). However, *most* of you should now be able to connect to the virtual machine by pointing your browser at: [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/lab/) where you should see something like this:
