This page is intended for use at our annual 'install fest' during Induction Week. It is intended To support you in getting the final key bits of software set up on your laptop/computer so that you are ready to begin your studies in Week 1. This is the full list of installers require.

## Install the Base Utilities First

Please make sure that you have installed the [Base Utilities](../req/base.qmd) *first* before installing the applications below. You can continue to download these in the background though!

## Installation

## Intel or Apple M1/M2?

Apple has migrated away from using Intel computer chips and now designs its own 'Silicon' chipset instead. Confusingly, these are often *also* referred to by their technical specification as `AMD64` (Intel) and `ARM64` (Apple). To find out which you have, click on the Apple icon (&#63743;) and select `About this Mac`. Look at the `Processor` section and you should see which type of computer you have.

## Windows 32- or 64-bit?

It is highly unlikely that you have a 32-bit machine, so if in doubt download the 64-bit version. It is also unlikely that you have an ARM device if you have an off-the-shelf Windows computer.
