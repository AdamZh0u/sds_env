This page is intended to get you up and running with *most* of the programming tools that you'll need for the year during Induction Week. This way, you are ready to begin your studies in Week 1.

## Install the Base Utilities First

Please make sure that you have installed the [Base Utilities](../req/base.qmd) *first* before installing the applications below. You can continue to download these in the background though!

:::

## Base Utilities

{{< include ../req/wsl.qmd >}}

{{< include _downloading.qmd >}}

## Next Steps

R and R-Studio can be installed fairly easily by double-clicking on the downloaded files and following the instructions. Docker is a bit more complex, so please follow the instructions below.

{{< include ../docker/_installing.qmd >}}

{{< include ../docker/_running.qmd >}}

{{< include ../docker/_success.qmd >}}

## Dealing with Errors
