# No Install Options

The following options provide alternatives for those who are unable to install the full programming environment on their *main* computer and would otherwise be unable to continue with the module. Each of these has pros and cons but they allow you to run code 'in the cloud' and so mean that any internet-connected device can be used to write and run code.

## UCL JupyterHub

## Configuration for Staff

Please see the [JupyterHub page](./jupyter_hub.qmd) for information about configuring a new environment.
:::

To connect to JupyterHub:

1. Start up the UCL VPN.
2. Connect to [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/)
3. Authenticate using your UCL credentials.
4. If you see a URL that ends in `tree?` please replace this with `lab?` to get the JupyterLab interface and not the original Jupyter Notebook interface (you can bookmark this page once it opens).
5. Create a new terminal: File > New > Terminal

Note that you need to replace `...` with the appropriate path (this will be obvious once you're logged in):

```shell
course_name="{{<var module.code>}}"

conda config --append envs_dirs /shared/groups/.../casa/envs

jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
```
