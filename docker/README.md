# Using Docker

You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (Desktop) to be able to install the Spatial Data Science (SDS) environment. If you do not wish to create an account with Docker then you may want to follow advice [provided here](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/6910#issuecomment-532393783) though we cannot condone it.

From there, you can follow the guides provided on [jreades.github.io/sds_env](jreades.github.io/sds_env/setup/env.html) for a quick-start and [Using Docker](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/docker/index.html) for help with making use of Quarto, Dask, and VSCode integration.
