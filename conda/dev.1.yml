# OVERVIEW
# This YAML script will attempt to install a Python virtual environment able to
# support the requirements of a Spatial Data Science or Geocomputation programme.
#
# INSTALLATION
# Note that, in the example commands below, you will need to replace {name} by the name 
# value specified as a configuration parameter below (the first line that does *not* 
# start with a hash (#). All the commands below should be run from the Terminal.
#
#######################
# NOTE: in the below, wherever you see '{name}'
# you should replace that with the name of the 
# environment you are installing (e.g. `sds2020`).
#######################
#
# If you've already installed this environment before:
#   conda remove --name {name} --all
#
# To install/reinstall the environment:
#   conda-env create -f environment.yml
#
# To install/update individual libraries you usually want to force the conda-forge channel:
#   conda install -c conda-forge osmnx
#
# A nice way to set the display name for the environment after activating the env:
#   conda activate {name}
#   python -m ipykernel install --name {name} --display-name "Friendly Name"
# To tidy up environments: 
#   jupyter kernelspec list
#   jupyter kernelspec uninstall unwanted-kernel 
#
# LAUNCH
# You can launch the 'old' notebook server by simply running:
#   jupyter notebook
# The more modern jupyter lab only seems to be launchable from within an environment:
#   conda activate {name}
#   jupyter lab
#
