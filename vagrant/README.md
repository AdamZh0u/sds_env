# Running SDS using Vagrant

The steps for this are fairly straightforward. You will need:
- To download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).
- To save a copy of the [Vagrantfile](./Vagrantfile) in a useful place on your computer.
- To launch the Terminal/Command Prompt
- Navigate to the directory where you saved the Vagrantfile (_e.g._ `cd ~/Downloads/`).
- Run `vagrant up` and then wait while Vagrant builds you new a virtual machine running the SDS image.

To shut down:
- Run `vagrant halt`
